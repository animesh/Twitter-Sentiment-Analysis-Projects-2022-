# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Projects (2022)
- By Nikita Silaparasetty

OS Used: Mac.

Python Version Used: Python 3.


## Introduction:

A huge proportion of the world's population use social media as a way to express their emotions or share their experiences and thoughts. One common social media platform is Twitter. By analysing tweets from various users, it is possible to understand their sentiments towards a particular topic or person. This data can then be used for further analysis, to find patterns, gain insights, and develop solutions. 


## Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to write a Python program that will input a particular query from a user (in this case, we use the example of 'Elon Musk'), gather tweets that contain this query, clean the tweets to remove unnecesarry content, identify the sentiments of users (positive, negative, neutral) towards this particular query, and then visualise it in a pie chart. A word cloud is also created to identify all the words that are most associated with this particular query.


## Use Case:

One use case of this particular project is for companies to understand how people feel about their products and services. For example, a clothing store can do a quick analysis of tweets from customers who have bought their products to see whether they have received mostly positive or negative reviews. Accordingly, they can make the required changes to their products (for example, the items of clothing that they sell) or their services (for example, the overall shopping experience of the customer). 


**Note: Some lines of code may change depending on the OS and the Python version that you use.**
