NOTE: This Repository is an add-on to my previous Repository, '10-Minute-Programs-for-Python-Beginners'. Hence, according to the dates when these projects have been uploaded, the Projects here are numbered as 6(a) and 6(b).


PROJECT - 6 (a)

In this project, we input a topic from the user (as a regular word or a hashtag). We then generate about a 100 tweets about this topic, and determine the polarity of each tweet to classify them into Positive, Negative, or Neutral. We then visualize the Data using a Pie Chart, Histogram, and Word Cloud.


PROJECT - 6 (b)

In this Project, we input a Twitter Handle from the user (Eg- @realdonaldtrump) to generate the most recent tweets from that account (about a 100). We then perform Sentiment Analysis on these Tweets by checking the polarity, to classify them into Positive, Negative, or Neutral. We then visualize this Data using a Pie Chart, Histogram, and Word Cloud.
